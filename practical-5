#5.2 Create an array of 10 numbers which is evenly spaced in the range of 1 to 5.
import numpy as np

#5.3 Create an array of 10 numbers which is evenly spaced in the range of 1 to 5 on log scale.

#5.6 Create a 2D array of size 4X3 with all elements in the range of 1 to 12 and perform following operations:
# 1)Display the created array.
brr1=np.arange(1,13) 
brr2=brr1.reshape(4,3)

# 2)Display the second row of the created array.
print(brr2[1,:])

# 3)Display the second column of the created array.
print(brr2[:,1])

# 4)Display alternate columns of the created array.
print(brr2[:,: :2])

# 5)Display second and fourth row of the created array
print(brr2[1::2,:])

#The probability for the value to be 20 is set to be 0.2
#The probability for the value to be 50 is set to be 0.1
#The probability for the value to be 75 is set to be 0.3
